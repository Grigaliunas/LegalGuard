## Testing Instructions

### Basic Functionality Testing

#### Test Safe Content Detection
1. Navigate to a well-established website such as `https://www.google.com`
2. Observe the LegalGuard shield icon in the top-right corner
3. Verify the icon displays green coloring indicating safe content
4. Click the shield icon to expand the information panel
5. Confirm the status shows "Content Safe" with no detected issues

#### Test Warning Conditions
1. **SSL Certificate Testing**: Navigate to a website without HTTPS or with a recently issued certificate
2. **Domain Age Testing**: Visit a newly registered domain (less than 14 days old)
3. Verify the shield icon turns yellow
4. Check that the information panel displays specific warning reasons
5. Confirm the warning details are clearly explained in the expandable panel

#### Test Illegal Content Detection
1. **Torrent File Testing**: Create a test HTML page containing links to .torrent files or magnet links
2. **Database Testing**: Configure a test database endpoint that returns positive matches for specific URLs
3. Navigate to the test page and verify the shield icon turns red
4. Confirm the status indicates "Illegal Content Detected"
5. Validate that specific detection reasons are displayed in the information panel

### Advanced Feature Testing

#### AI Analysis Testing
1. **API Configuration**: Enter a valid OpenAI API key in the extension settings
2. **Enable AI Analysis**: Toggle the AI analysis feature in the settings panel
3. **Test AI Functionality**: Navigate to a webpage with ambiguous content
4. Click the "AI Analysis" button in the extension popup or content panel
5. Verify the AI provides a risk assessment with explanation
6. Confirm the analysis result is properly categorized as high, medium, or low risk

#### Settings and Configuration Testing
1. **Access Settings Page**: Right-click the extension icon and select "Options"
2. **Modify Detection Parameters**: Adjust SSL certificate age and domain registration thresholds
3. **Database Management**: Add and remove illegal content database URLs
4. **Settings Persistence**: Verify settings are saved and retained across browser sessions
5. **Reset Functionality**: Test the reset to defaults option

### Performance and Compatibility Testing

#### Cross-Site Testing
Test the extension across various website types to ensure consistent performance:
- E-commerce sites with SSL certificates
- News websites with multimedia content
- Social media platforms
- Government and educational domains

3. **Background Processing**: Verify the extension operates efficiently without blocking page rendering

### Error Handling Testing

#### Network Connectivity Testing
1. **Offline Scenarios**: Test extension behavior when internet connectivity is unavailable
2. **API Timeouts**: Simulate slow network conditions and verify graceful timeout handling
3. **Database Unavailability**: Test scenarios where illegal content databases are unreachable

#### Invalid Configuration Testing
1. **Malformed API Keys**: Enter invalid OpenAI API keys and verify error handling
2. **Invalid Database URLs**: Add malformed database URLs and test error responses
3. **Extreme Parameter Values**: Set detection thresholds to extreme values and validate behavior

## Configuration Options
